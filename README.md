Aurora
======

Aurora runs on SmartMatrix, a dynamic LED art display and music visualizer.

[![SmartMatrix](https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/projects/979600/photo-original.jpg?v=1432073505&w=640&h=480&fit=crop&auto=format&q=92&s=e7f872a3cb2df45c5fbad0a251e4025c)](http://pixl.mx/kick2015)

SmartMatrix is a self-contained 32x32 pixel LED matrix display for music visualization, dynamic patterns, pixel art, and more!

Customize what's on the screen with the included remote control: choose what's playing, show a clock or message on top, and change settings, all from the remote. You don't need a computer or phone to control what's on the screen.

Features
--------

* Procedural pattern viewer
* Animated GIF slideshow viewer
* Remote control, allowing for ease of use.
* Optional Clock display in the foreground, over animation and pattern slideshows (**requires real-time clock chip**).
